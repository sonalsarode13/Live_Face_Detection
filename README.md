🧠 Real-Time Face Recognition Using DeepFace & OpenCV

This project implements a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV, DeepFace, and Python threading. The system captures live video from a webcam, compares detected faces against a stored reference image, and displays whether the face matches or does not match in real time.

📌 Features

🎥 Live webcam video capture

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Face verification using DeepFace

⚡ Threaded processing for smooth real-time performance

🖼️ Reference image-based matching

❌ Handles no-face and detection errors safely

🧠 AI-powered face recognition

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (cv2) – Video capture and display

DeepFace – Face recognition and verification

Threading – Non-blocking face verification
